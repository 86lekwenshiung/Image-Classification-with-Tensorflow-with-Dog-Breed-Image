## 4.0 Approach to Problem Solving
We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
    - Getting Image & Labels
    - Create own validation set
    - Turning Images into tensors
    - Creating and visualisizing data batches
3. Modelling
    - Seting up model layers
    - Creating Callbacks
    - Training Model on a subset of data. 
    - Making & evaluating predictions using trained model
4. Making Prediction
    - Making Prediction on custom images
